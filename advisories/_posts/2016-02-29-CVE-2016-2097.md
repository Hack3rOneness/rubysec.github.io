  title: Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in Action View
  description: "\nThere is a possible directory traversal and information leak vulnerability
    \nin Action View. This was meant to be fixed on CVE-2016-0752. However the 3.2
    \npatch was not covering all the scenarios. This vulnerability has been \nassigned
    the CVE identifier CVE-2016-2097.\n\nVersions Affected:  3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x\nNot
    affected:       4.2+\nFixed Versions:     3.2.22.2, 4.1.14.2\n\nImpact \n------
    \nApplications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method in a\ncontroller
    may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.\n\nImpacted code will
    look something like this:\n\n```ruby\ndef index\n  render params[:id]\nend\n```\n\nCarefully
    crafted requests can cause the above code to render files from\nunexpected places
    like outside the application's view directory, and can\npossibly escalate this
    to a remote code execution attack.\n\nAll users running an affected release should
    either upgrade or use one of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n\nReleases \n--------
    \nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n-----------
    \nA workaround to this issue is to not pass arbitrary user input to the `render`\nmethod.
    Instead, verify that data before passing it to the `render` method.\n\nFor example,
    change this:\n\n```ruby\ndef index\n  render params[:id]\nend\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n```ruby\ndef
    index\n  render verify_template(params[:id])\nend\n\nprivate\ndef verify_template(name)\n
    \ # add verification logic particular to your application here\nend\n```\n\nPatches
    \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
    patches \nfor it. It is in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n*
    3-2-render_data_leak_2.patch - Patch for 3.2 series\n* 4-1-render_data_leak_2.patch
    - Patch for 4.1 series\n\nCredits \n------- \nThanks to both Jyoti Singh and Tobias
    Kraze from makandra for reporting this \nand working with us in the patch!\n"
