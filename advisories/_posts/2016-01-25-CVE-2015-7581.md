  title: Object leak vulnerability for wildcard controller routes in Action Pack
  description: ! "There is an object leak vulnerability for wildcard controllers in
    Action Pack. \nThis vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7581.
    \n\nVersions Affected:  >= 4.0.0 and < 5.0.0.beta1 \nNot affected:       < 4.0.0,
    5.0.0.beta1 and newer \nFixed Versions:     4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1 \n\nImpact \n------
    \nUsers that have a route that contains the string \":controller\" are susceptible
    \nto objects being leaked globally which can lead to unbounded memory growth.
    \nTo identify if your application is vulnerable, look for routes that contain
    \n\":controller\". \n\nInternally, Action Pack keeps a map of \"url controller
    name\" to \"controller \nclass name\".  This map is cached globally, and is populated
    even if the \ncontroller class doesn't actually exist. \n\nAll users running an
    affected release should either upgrade or use one of the \nworkarounds immediately.
    \n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.
    \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.
    \n\nPatches \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we
    have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am
    format and consist of a single changeset. \n\n* 4-1-wildcard_route.patch - Patch
    for 4.1 series \n* 4-2-wildcard_route.patch - Patch for 4.2 series \n\nPlease
    note that only the 4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of
    earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we
    cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported
    releases.\n"
