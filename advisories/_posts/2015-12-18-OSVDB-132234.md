    rack-attack Gem for Ruby missing normalization before request path
    processing
  date: 2015-12-18
  description: "When using rack-attack with a rails app, developers expect the request\npath
    to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so\na request path
    \"/login/\" becomes \"/login\" by the time you're in\nActionController.\n\nSince
    Rack::Attack runs before ActionDispatch, the request path is not\nyet normalized.
    This can cause throttles and blacklists to not work as\nexpected.\n\nE.g., a throttle:\n\n`throttle('logins',
    ...) {|req| req.path == \"/login\" }`\n\nwould not match a request to '/login/',
    though Rails would route\n'/login/' to the same '/login' action. \n"
