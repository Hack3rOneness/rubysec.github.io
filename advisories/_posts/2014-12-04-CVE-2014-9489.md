  description: ! "The gollum-grit_adapter gem contains a flaw that can allow arbitrary\ncommand
    execution. \n\nGrit implements its search functionality by shelling out to `git
    grep`. In \nturn, `git grep` takes a `-O` or `--open-files-in-pages` option that
    will \npipe the results of `grep` to an arbitrary process. By failing to properly\nsanitize
    user input search parameters, an attacker can thus perform command \nexecution.\n\nNote
    that the grep result must find the string 'master' (or \nwhatever is the default
    branch that gollum uses) in any of the wiki's\ndocuments for this to succeed.\n"
