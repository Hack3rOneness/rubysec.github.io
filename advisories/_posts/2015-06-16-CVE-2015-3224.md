  title: "IP whitelist bypass in Web Console \n"
  date: 2015-06-16
  description: "Specially crafted remote requests can spoof their origin, bypassing
    the IP whitelist, in any environment where Web Console is enabled (development
    and test, by default). \n\nUsers whose application is only accessible from localhost
    (as is the default behaviour in Rails 4.2) are not affected, unless a local proxy
    is involved. \n\nAll affected users should either upgrade or use one of the work
    arounds immediately. \n\nTo work around this issue, turn off web-console in all
    environments, by removing/commenting it from the application's Gemfile. \n"
