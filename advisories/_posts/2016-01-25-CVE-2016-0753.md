  title: Possible Input Validation Circumvention in Active Model
  description: "There is a possible input validation circumvention vulnerability in
    Active \nModel. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2016-0753.
    \n\nVersions Affected:  4.1.0 and newer \nNot affected:       4.0.13 and older
    \nFixed Versions:     5.0.0.beta1.1, 4.2.5.1, 4.1.14.1 \n\nImpact \n------ \nCode
    that uses Active Model based models (including Active Record models) and \ndoes
    not validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject to \nan
    attack where specially crafted input will cause the model to skip \nvalidations.
    \n\nVulnerable code will look something like this: \n\n```ruby \nSomeModel.new(unverified_user_input)
    \n``` \n\nRails users using Strong Parameters are generally not impacted by this
    issue \nas they are encouraged to whitelist parameters and must specifically opt-out
    \nof input verification using the `permit!` method to allow mass assignment. \n\nFor
    example, a vulnerable Rails application will have code that looks like \nthis:
    \n\n```ruby \ndef create \n  params.permit! # allow all parameters \n  @user =
    User.new params[:users] \nend \n``` \n\nActive Model and Active Record objects
    are not equipped to handle arbitrary \nuser input.  It is up to the application
    to verify input before passing it to \nActive Model models.  Rails users already
    have Strong Parameters in place to \nhandle white listing, but applications using
    Active Model and Active Record \noutside of a Rails environment may be impacted.
    \n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
    the \nworkarounds immediately. \n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe FIXED releases are
    available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nThere are several
    workarounds depending on the application.  Inside a Rails \napplication, stop
    using `permit!`.  Outside a Rails application, either use \nHash#slice to select
    the parameters you need, or integrate Strong Parameters \nwith your application.
    \n\nPatches \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we
    have provided patches for \nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am
    format and consist of a \nsingle changeset. \n\n* 4-1-validation_skip.patch -
    Patch for 4.1 series \n* 4-2-validation_skip.patch - Patch for 4.2 series \n*
    5-0-validation_skip.patch - Patch for 5.0 series \n\nPlease note that only the
    4.1.x and 4.2.x series are supported at present. Users \nof earlier unsupported
    releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we \ncannot guarantee the
    continued availability of security fixes for unsupported \nreleases. \n\nCredits
    \n------- \nThanks to: \n\n[John Backus](https://github.com/backus) from BlockScore
    for reporting this! \n"
